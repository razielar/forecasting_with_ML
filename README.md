## 1) <a id='one'></a> Time Series as regression

### Time series types

Regular types are easier to forecast them.

### Time series components

* **Trend**: long term change in the mean of the time series.
* **Seasonality**: regular, repetitive fluctuations.
* **Cyclicity**: irregular fluctuations over longer time periods. For example, recessions or wars.
* **Residuals**: error term.

### Forecasting models

Some advantages of using ML models: 
* Interpretability
* Model non-linear or complex relationships
* Model multiple time series simultaneously
* Combine features from: the time series and exogenous data sources
